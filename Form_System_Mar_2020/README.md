# Form System Project

This was my first group project for my Object Oriented Design class. The goal of the project was to create a generic form system, specifically validation and
processing of input received from standard GUI form fields.

While this was not the most exciting nor comprehensive project I have done, it was my first real exposure to working in shared respositories in Git, as well as working with a team to code in general.

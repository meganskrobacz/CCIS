# Othello/Reversi Project

In this project, we were tasked to code a playable version of the game Othello/Reversi (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi) using only Python. Some basic starter code for the board was provided by the professor, but the vast majority was left up to us; namely, implementing the rules and workflows, as well as creating a functioning AI to play against.

This was my first big foray into the world of programming. I do have separate files here which explain my design for the game in general, and the AI in particular, if you are interested in learning more.

In the future, I hope to have time to refactor this code, and perhaps re-write it in an object-oriented language such as Java.

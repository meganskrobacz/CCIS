# Differential Privacy Project - May 2020

As part of my privacy engineering course in Summer 2020, we were tasked to create a video which would attempt to teach the concept of differential privacy to a layperson. While we were certainly not experts in our own right, this was a great project to understand cutting-edge methodologies being considered in the privacy engineering space.

The static Powerpoint presentation for this project can be found in this repository.

The final video can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2gx9-MAZQIGtptlFSwSTv-JYB7yUGgVN

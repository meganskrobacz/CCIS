# COVID-19 Research Project - Contact Tracing in the Era of COVID-19

For the capstone of my privacy engineering course in Summer 2020, we were tasked to pick any topic related to privacy we were interested in, and conduct a research project on that topic with our findings. Along with another classmate, I chose to investigate the topic of Contact Tracing, particularly in the era of COVID-19. 

The abstract for our paper is as follows:

<em>Currently we are in the middle of a serious pandemic. As there is no known, proven cure or vaccine which can help reduce the impact of COVID-19, multiple countries are choosing to endorse the method of contact tracing to try and contain the spread. Contact tracing can be implemented manually, but for this paper we will be evaluating tech solutions utilized by the governments of multiple countries in various forms. We will analyze contact tracing strategies used by Singapore, Australia, South Korea and Switzerland, as well as the Google/Apple API that allows for several contact tracing apps to function. We will evaluate the security and privacy concerns associated with these solutions, how different they are from each other in their implementation, and the vulnerabilities associated with them. Finally, we will holistically discuss the subject of contact tracing, seeking to understand whether there could be an ideal implementation of contact tracing in the future, given the inherent problems it must overcome to be effective. </em>

The paper in PDF format can be found in this repository. We also created a video presentation of our findings here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roRzwn7wtso

# CCIS
Welcome to my personal Github! Here I will keep a repository of all signature projects I've undetaken during my time at Northeastern University Seattle. 

As a student of the Align program, I have no prior formal background in computer science, and began my educational journey into the CS world in September 2019. I'm proud of what I was able to accomplish and hope you can see my progression within a short amount of time as I move through my educational journey.
